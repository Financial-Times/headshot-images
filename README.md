## Headshot Images

:warning: This is the old repository for Origami headshot images, which are included via the [Origami Image Service](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2) custom `fthead` scheme. New headshots are not uploaded here, they are now added directly to Methode and included in a page via the `ftcms` scheme.

### Existing headshots

Existing headshots will be available via v2 of the Image Service indefinitely. If v2 of the Image Service is decommissioned then we will ensure that existing headshot URLs on the website do not break.

The [headshots entry in the Origami Registry](https://registry.origami.ft.com/components/headshot-images) will remain in place, so you can still view all of the deprecated headshots here.

### New Headshots

Speak to Rich Martin on Slack or via his FT email if you need a new headshot added.
